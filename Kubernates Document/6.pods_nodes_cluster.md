**Topic 2: Pods, Nodes, and Clusters** — the *core building blocks* of Kubernetes.

Once you deeply understand these three, you’ll know **how and where** your workloads actually run inside Kubernetes.

# ⚙️ Topic 2 — Pods, Nodes, and Clusters (In-Depth Theory)

---

## 🧱 1️⃣ Kubernetes Cluster — The Whole System

A **Kubernetes cluster** is the *complete environment* that runs and manages your containerized applications.

It includes:

* **Control Plane** → the *brain* (decision-maker)
* **Worker Nodes** → the *muscles* (where your apps run)

---

### 🔹 What is a Cluster?

A **cluster** is a collection of **machines (nodes)** — both **control plane nodes** and **worker nodes** — that together form a managed container orchestration system.

You can imagine it like a company:

* Control Plane = Management team
* Worker Nodes = Employees doing the actual work
* Pods = Small teams assigned to specific projects

---

### 🔹 Cluster Composition

A minimal cluster has:

* 1 **Control Plane node**
* 1 or more **Worker nodes**

In production, clusters usually have:

* Multiple control planes for **high availability**
* Multiple workers for **scalability**

---

### 🔹 Cluster Responsibilities

1. **Orchestrate Containers**

   * Automatically start, stop, or move containers.
2. **Manage Desired State**

   * Keeps the system exactly as you define it.
3. **Scale Applications**

   * Increase/decrease replicas as needed.
4. **Load Balance Traffic**

   * Distribute requests evenly among Pods.
5. **Self-Healing**

   * Restart failed containers automatically.
6. **Secure and Isolate Workloads**

   * Uses namespaces, RBAC, and network policies.

---

### 🔹 Cluster Communication Flow

```
User (kubectl) → API Server → Scheduler → Kubelet → Container Runtime → Pod
```

Each component talks to the next one through **secure, authenticated channels**.

---

### 🔹 Cluster Example (High-Level)

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        KUBERNETES CLUSTER                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    CONTROL PLANE (Master)                    |
|  - API Server  - etcd  - Scheduler  - Controller Manager      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|                   WORKER NODE 1  |  WORKER NODE 2             |
|  - kubelet      - kube-proxy     |  - kubelet  - kube-proxy   |
|  - Pods: App A, DB               |  - Pods: App B, Cache      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

So, a **cluster** = multiple **nodes**, coordinated by the **control plane**, running many **pods**.

---

## 🧩 2️⃣ Node — The Worker Machine

A **Node** is a **physical or virtual machine** that runs workloads (Pods).
Each node is managed by the **control plane** and includes:

* `kubelet` → talks to the control plane
* `kube-proxy` → manages networking
* **Container runtime** → runs containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O)

---

### 🔹 Node Responsibilities

1. **Host Pods**

   * Each node runs one or more pods.
2. **Report Health**

   * Node status (Ready/NotReady) is sent to API server.
3. **Provide Resources**

   * CPU, memory, disk, network for pods.
4. **Execute Scheduling Decisions**

   * Runs whatever pods the scheduler assigns.

---

### 🔹 Node States

* **Ready:** Node is healthy and can accept pods.
* **NotReady:** Node is unhealthy or disconnected.
* **SchedulingDisabled:** Node is cordoned (no new pods).

---

### 🔹 Node Architecture

```
+---------------------------------------------+
|                  NODE                       |
|---------------------------------------------|
|  kubelet         → Manages pods on node     |
|  kube-proxy       → Networking rules         |
|  containerd/CRI-O → Runs containers          |
|---------------------------------------------|
|  POD 1: frontend                            |
|     ├─ nginx container                      |
|  POD 2: backend                             |
|     ├─ python-app container                 |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

Each Node can host **multiple Pods**, depending on available resources.

---

### 🔹 Node Management Commands

| Command                             | Description                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `kubectl get nodes`                 | Lists all nodes                       |
| `kubectl describe node <node-name>` | Detailed info                         |
| `kubectl cordon <node>`             | Marks node unschedulable              |
| `kubectl drain <node>`              | Moves all pods off node (maintenance) |
| `kubectl uncordon <node>`           | Allows new pods again                 |

---

### 🔹 Node Health Check

Kubernetes periodically checks node health through the `kubelet` and updates the API Server.
If a node fails for too long, the **controller-manager** automatically reschedules pods on healthy nodes.

---

## 🧫 3️⃣ Pod — The Smallest Deployable Unit

Now we come to the **Pod**, the *core execution unit* in Kubernetes.

> 🧩 **Definition:**
> A **Pod** is the *smallest deployable object* in Kubernetes that can run one or more containers.

---

### 🔹 Why Pods?

Containers (like Docker) are great — but Kubernetes adds features **beyond** individual containers:

* Networking
* Storage
* Scaling
* Scheduling

To manage all these, Kubernetes wraps one or more containers into a **Pod** — as a single, schedulable unit.

---

### 🔹 Pod Characteristics

1. **Smallest deployable unit** — you can’t run a container directly; you deploy Pods.
2. **One or more containers** — typically one, but sometimes multiple tightly-coupled containers.
3. **Shared environment** — containers in a Pod share:

   * The same **network namespace** (IP address)
   * The same **storage volumes**
   * The same **lifecycle**

---

### 🔹 Pod Structure Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

This YAML defines a Pod named `nginx-pod` running one container (`nginx`).

---

### 🔹 Multi-Container Pods

Sometimes, two or more containers run in one Pod — for example:

* **Main application container**
* **Sidecar container** (for logging, proxy, etc.)

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: node:20
  - name: logger
    image: fluentd
```

Both containers share the same IP and volumes, so they can talk over `localhost`.

---

### 🔹 Pod Lifecycle Phases

| Phase         | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Pending**   | Pod accepted but not yet scheduled         |
| **Running**   | Pod bound to a node and containers started |
| **Succeeded** | All containers exited successfully         |
| **Failed**    | One or more containers failed              |
| **Unknown**   | Node communication issue                   |

---

### 🔹 Pod Restart Policies

| Policy        | Description                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Always**    | Restart on failure (default) |
| **OnFailure** | Restart only on failure      |
| **Never**     | Do not restart               |

---

### 🔹 Pod Networking

* Each Pod has its **own IP address**.
* Containers inside the same Pod share this IP.
* Pods on different nodes communicate via the **cluster network** managed by `kube-proxy` and CNI plugin (e.g., Calico, Flannel).

---

### 🔹 Pod Storage

* Pods can mount **Volumes** (persistent or ephemeral) to store data.
* When the Pod dies, ephemeral storage is lost unless it uses a **PersistentVolume**.

---

### 🔹 Pod Management

| Command                          | Description       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `kubectl get pods`               | List pods         |
| `kubectl describe pod <pod>`     | Detailed info     |
| `kubectl logs <pod>`             | View logs         |
| `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash` | Access inside pod |
| `kubectl delete pod <pod>`       | Delete pod        |

---

### 🔹 Self-Healing Example

If you delete a Pod managed by a **Deployment** or **ReplicaSet**, Kubernetes automatically creates a new one — keeping the desired state.

---

### 🔹 Why Not Directly Use Containers?

Because Kubernetes adds:

* Auto-healing
* Networking abstraction
* Persistent storage
* Scaling
* Declarative management

Pods make containers “Kubernetes-native.”

## 🧠 Summary — Relationship Between Cluster, Node, and Pod

| Level       | Description                                        | Example                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Cluster** | The entire system containing control plane + nodes | Company                       |
| **Node**    | A single machine (VM/physical) running workloads   | Employee workstation          |
| **Pod**     | The smallest runnable unit containing containers   | Task team on that workstation |

---

### Visualization

```
CLUSTER
│
├── Node 1
│    ├── Pod A (nginx)
│    └── Pod B (redis)
│
└── Node 2
     ├── Pod C (app)
     └── Pod D (logger)
```

Each Node runs several Pods; all Nodes together form one Cluster.

---

### Real-World Analogy

| Concept       | Analogy          | Description                          |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Cluster**   | A company        | The whole system                     |
| **Node**      | An office branch | Each machine                         |
| **Pod**       | A team           | Group of containers working together |
| **Container** | An employee      | Actual process doing the work        |
