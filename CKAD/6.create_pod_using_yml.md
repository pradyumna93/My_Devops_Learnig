# 🧩 Demo: Creating a Pod Using a YAML Definition File

## 🎯 Objective

In this demo, we’ll learn how to **create a Kubernetes Pod** using a **YAML definition file**.

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Choosing an Editor

You can use **any text editor** to create YAML files — such as Notepad, Notepad++, Atom, or Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

For this demo, we’ll use **Visual Studio Code**, a lightweight and free IDE that provides:

* Syntax highlighting for YAML
* Auto-indentation and formatting
* Extensions for Kubernetes and YAML validation

You can download VS Code from:
👉 [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

---

## 🗂 Step 2: Setting Up the Project

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Create a new folder named `pod`.
3. Inside this folder, create a new file named `pod-definition.yaml`.

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Basic Structure of a Kubernetes Definition File

Every Kubernetes YAML definition file follows this structure:

```yaml
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:
```

These are the **four root-level fields** in any Kubernetes object.

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Creating the Pod Definition

Let’s define our Pod step by step.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
```

### Explanation:

* **apiVersion:** The API version used by the object (`v1` for Pods)
* **kind:** The type of object (`Pod`)
* **metadata:** Contains identifying information such as name and labels

---

## ⚙️ Step 5: Defining the Pod Specification (spec)

Under the `spec` section, we define the **containers** that run inside the Pod.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
```

### Explanation:

* **containers:** List (array) of containers inside the Pod
* **name:** Name of the container
* **image:** Docker image to use (in this case, `nginx`)

If you want to run multiple containers in the same Pod, add more items to the list:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: frontend
      image: nginx
    - name: backend
      image: redis
```

Each container is represented as a separate item under the list (`-`).

---

## ✅ Step 6: Complete YAML File

Here’s the final Pod definition file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
```

---

## 🚀 Step 7: Deploying the Pod

1. Save the file as **pod-definition.yaml**.
2. Open your **terminal** (in VS Code or any shell) and connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Verify there are no existing Pods:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
4. Create the Pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f pod-definition.yaml
   ```
5. Check the Pod status:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

You should see the new Pod (`myapp-pod`) being created and soon enter the **Running** state.

---

## 🧹 Step 8: Clean Up

When you’re done, delete the Pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod myapp-pod
```

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks for Working with YAML in VS Code

* Install the **YAML** and **Kubernetes** extensions from the VS Code Marketplace.
* Use **auto-formatting (Shift + Alt + F)** to maintain indentation.
* Hover over YAML keys to get **intellisense and documentation**.
* The **Kubernetes extension** can help validate and visualize your YAML structure.

---

## 🏁 Summary

In this demo, we learned how to:

* Create a Kubernetes Pod definition file in YAML
* Understand key sections: `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, and `spec`
* Deploy the Pod using `kubectl create -f`
* Verify and manage the Pod lifecycle
