# 📘 **Kubernetes — Endpoints Explained**

---

## 🔹 **What Are Endpoints in Kubernetes?**

**Definition:**
In Kubernetes, an **Endpoint** represents the **set of Pod IPs and ports** that a **Service** sends traffic to.

In simple terms:
➡️ **Service → identifies matching Pods → lists them as Endpoints.**

---

## 🔹 **How Endpoints Work**

Let’s break it down step-by-step 👇

1. **Pods have Labels**

   * Example:

     ```yaml
     labels:
       app: frontend
     ```

2. **Services have Selectors**

   * Example:

     ```yaml
     selector:
       app: frontend
     ```

3. The **Service uses these selectors** to find all Pods with matching labels.

4. The IP addresses and ports of those Pods become the **Endpoints** for that Service.

---

## 🔹 **Endpoints in Action**

### Example Setup

* Service selector → `app: frontend`
* Three Pods labeled → `app: frontend`

Then the Service creates **three endpoints**, one for each Pod:

```
Endpoints: 10.244.0.5:8080, 10.244.0.6:8080, 10.244.0.7:8080
```

✅ This means traffic to the Service will be load-balanced across these three Pods.

---

## 🔹 **How to View Endpoints**

**Commands:**

```bash
kubectl describe svc <service-name>
```

➡️ Check the **Endpoints** section in the output.

Or view them separately:

```bash
kubectl get endpoints
```

---

## 🔹 **Common Scenarios**

### 🟢 Case 1 — Expected Behavior

Your Service and Pods have matching labels →
You’ll see valid endpoints listed.

**Example:**

```
Endpoints: 10.244.0.5:8080, 10.244.0.6:8080
```

### 🔴 Case 2 — Zero Endpoints

If your Service’s selector **does not match any Pod labels**,
then **no endpoints** will appear:

```
Endpoints: <none>
```

✅ This means traffic cannot reach any Pods — check labels and selectors.

### 🟡 Case 3 — Extra Endpoints

If an **extra Pod** shares the same label unintentionally,
it will also appear as an endpoint, and the Service will route traffic to it too.

---

## 🔹 **Why Endpoints Matter**

* Help verify whether a **Service is correctly linked** to its Pods.
* Quickly detect **label–selector mismatches**.
* Useful for **troubleshooting connectivity issues**.

---

## 🔹 **Real Example**

Imagine a Service named `green-service`:

```bash
kubectl describe svc green-service
```

Output:

```
Endpoints: 10.244.0.9:8080
```

✅ This means `green-service` is routing traffic to **one Pod** only.

If multiple Pods matched, you’d see multiple IPs and ports listed as endpoints.

## 📘 **Summary Table**

| Concept                 | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Endpoints**           | List of Pod IPs + ports a Service targets            |
| **Created By**          | Kubernetes automatically, based on Service selectors |
| **Viewed Using**        | `kubectl describe svc` or `kubectl get endpoints`    |
| **If Empty (`<none>`)** | No Pods match the selector                           |
| **If Multiple**         | Service load balances traffic across Pods            |

---

## 💡 **Quick Tip**

If your app isn’t reachable via a Service,
always check this first:

```bash
kubectl describe svc <service-name>
```

If `Endpoints: <none>`, fix the **Pod labels** or **Service selectors**.
