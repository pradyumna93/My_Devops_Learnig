## 🧠 **Kubernetes Deployment – Question & Answer Notes**

---

### **1. How many Deployments, Pods, and ReplicaSets are present on the system?**

**Answer:**
To check how many Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods exist in the current namespace, use the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get pods
```

Or view all of them at once using:

```bash
kubectl get all
```

This command displays all running Deployments, ReplicaSets, Pods, and Services in your namespace.

---

### **2. How many Pods are ready for the Deployment?**

**Answer:**
Run the following command to check how many Pods are in the **Ready** state for a specific Deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name>
```

Example:

```bash
kubectl get deployment httpd-frontend
```

The **READY** column in the output shows the ratio of ready Pods versus desired Pods (e.g., `3/3` means all 3 Pods are ready).

---

### **3. What is the image used to create the Pods for the Deployment?**

**Answer:**
To find the container image used by the Pods in a Deployment, run:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name> | grep -i image
```

This command extracts the image information from the Deployment specification.
Alternatively, you can inspect one of the Pods:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -i image
```

---

### **4. Create a new Deployment using both YAML definition file and command**

---

#### **A. Using Command:**

```bash
kubectl create deployment httpd-frontend --image=httpd:2.4-alpine --replicas=3
```

This command creates a Deployment named **httpd-frontend**, runs **3 replicas**, and uses the image **httpd:2.4-alpine**.

---

#### **B. Using YAML Definition File (`httpd-deployment.yaml`):**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpd-frontend
  labels:
    app: httpd-frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd-frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd-frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd-container
        image: httpd:2.4-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply the file using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f httpd-deployment.yaml
```

---

✅ **Summary:**

* **Check Deployments, Pods, ReplicaSets:** `kubectl get all`
* **Check ready Pods:** `kubectl get deployment <name>`
* **Check image used:** `kubectl describe deployment <name>`
* **Create Deployment:** via `kubectl create` command or YAML file
