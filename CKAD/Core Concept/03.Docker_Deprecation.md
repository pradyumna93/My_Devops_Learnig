# 🐳 Understanding Docker Deprecation in Kubernetes

Every time we’ve mentioned **Docker** in this course, a common question comes up:

> “Why are we still talking about Docker if it’s deprecated?”

That’s a great question — and I realize there’s quite a bit of confusion around what **Docker deprecation** in Kubernetes actually means. So, let’s take a moment to clear that up.

---

## 🕰️ A Bit of Background

Originally, **Docker** was the **first and only supported container runtime** for **Kubernetes**.
However, as Kubernetes grew, the community wanted it to support other container runtimes as well — not just Docker.

To make this possible, Kubernetes introduced the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** — a standard that allows different runtimes to plug into Kubernetes seamlessly.

---

## ⚙️ What Docker Actually Includes

Docker isn’t just a runtime — it’s a **complete platform** made up of multiple tools and components, including:

* The **Docker CLI** (Command Line Interface)
* The **Docker API**
* **Build tools** for creating container images
* Support for **volumes** and **security** features
* The **container runtime**, known as **runc**
* And the **daemon** that manages containers, called **containerd**

Among these components, **containerd** is the **CRI-compatible** part.
This means **containerd** can communicate **directly with Kubernetes**, without needing the rest of Docker.

---

## 🧩 The Change: From Docker to containerd

Once **containerd** became a standalone and fully CRI-compliant runtime, **Kubernetes no longer needed the full Docker stack**.
Other tools that Docker provided — like the CLI, API, and build tools — were no longer necessary inside Kubernetes, since Kubernetes itself (and other ecosystem tools) took over those responsibilities.

As a result, Kubernetes was able to **deprecate Docker as a runtime** — meaning it stopped using Docker’s runtime layer.

However, this **does not mean Docker is dead** or useless.
Docker remains the **most popular container platform** in the world and is still heavily used for **local development, image building, and testing**.

---

## 🚀 What This Means for You

So when you hear “Docker is deprecated in Kubernetes,” it simply means **Kubernetes doesn’t use Docker’s runtime internally anymore** — not that Docker itself has disappeared.

You can **absolutely continue using Docker** for learning, building images, or running containers locally.
In fact, throughout this course, we’ll still use Docker as an example to explain container concepts — because it’s familiar, easy to use, and conceptually the same.

And if you don’t have Docker installed on your machine, or you’re using **containerd**, don’t worry.
You can still run the same examples — just replace `docker` commands with the equivalent **`nerdctl`** commands most of the time.

### ✅ In Summary

* Docker was the **original runtime** used by Kubernetes.
* Kubernetes introduced the **CRI** to support multiple runtimes.
* **containerd** became the CRI-compliant runtime and replaced Docker inside Kubernetes.
* **Docker is not gone** — it’s still widely used for building and testing containers.
* When learning, it’s perfectly fine to use Docker for examples and practice.
