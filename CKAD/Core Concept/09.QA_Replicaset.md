## 🧠 **Kubernetes ReplicaSet – Question & Answer Notes**

---

### **1. How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?**

**Answer:**
Run the following command to list all ReplicaSets in the current namespace:

```bash
kubectl get replicaset
```

This command shows the number of ReplicaSets, along with their desired, current, and ready pod counts.

---

### **2. How many pods are desired in the new ReplicaSet?**

**Answer:**
You can check the desired number of pods for a ReplicaSet using:

```bash
kubectl get replicaset new-replicaset
```

The **DESIRED** column indicates how many pods the ReplicaSet aims to maintain.

---

### **3. What is the image used to create the pods in the new ReplicaSet?**

**Answer:**
To check the container image used by the ReplicaSet:

```bash
kubectl describe replicaset new-replicaset | grep -i image
```

This will display the image name (e.g., `nginx:latest`, `redis`, etc.) used in the pod template.

---

### **4. How many pods are ready in the new ReplicaSet?**

**Answer:**
Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get replicaset new-replicaset
```

Check the **READY** column — it shows how many pods are currently in the Ready state.

---

### **5. Now delete one of the four pods directly using kubectl delete and check how many pods are present.**

**Answer:**
Delete one pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

Then verify the pods again:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You’ll still see **4 pods** running because the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new pod to maintain the desired count.

---

### **6. Why are 4 pods still present after deleting one?**

**Answer:**
The ReplicaSet continuously monitors and ensures the desired number of pods are running.
If one pod is deleted or crashes, the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new one to maintain the defined replica count — ensuring **high availability**.

### **7. How to create a ReplicaSet (using both command and YAML)?**

#### **A. Using Command:**

```bash
kubectl create replicaset myapp-rs --image=nginx --replicas=3
```

#### **B. Using YAML File (replicaset.yaml):**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myapp-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
```

Then apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
```

---

### **8. How to delete a ReplicaSet?**

**Answer:**
You can delete the ReplicaSet (and its pods) using either of the following commands:

```bash
kubectl delete replicaset myapp-rs
```

Or, if created from a file:

```bash
kubectl delete -f replicaset.yaml
```

---

### **9. How to scale the ReplicaSet?**

**Answer:**
You can scale manually in two ways:

#### **A. Using command:**

```bash
kubectl scale replicaset myapp-rs --replicas=6
```

#### **B. Updating YAML and reapplying:**

Edit the YAML:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 6
```

Then apply changes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
```
